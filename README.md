# Credit Risk Prediction
A MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH TO CREDIT RATING PREDICTION AND EVALUATION 

Credit rating prediction is a crucial task in the banking and financial industry. Financial firms want to identify the likelihood of customers repaying loans or credit. With the advent of machine learning algorithms and big data analytics, it is now possible to automate and improve the accuracy of credit rating prediction. 
In this research, we aim to develop a machine learning-based approach for customer credit rating prediction. Machine learning algorithms, including decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and logistic regression, were evaluated and compared in terms of accuracy, precision, and AUC. Feature selection was also performed to analyze the importance of different features in predicting credit ratings. Findings suggested that status, duration, credit history, amount, savings, other debtors, property, and employment duration are the most important features in predicting credit ratings.
Results showed that the support vector machine algorithm did best in predicting bad credits, achieving an accuracy of 79.7%, AUROC of 0.76, and a precision of 0.88. After optimization, an AUROC of 78% was obtained. This is a 78% accuracy for properly identifying bad credits. 
This research demonstrates the potential of machine learning algorithms for customer credit rating prediction and could have significant implications for the banking and financial industry by enabling more accurate and efficient credit rating predictions and reducing the risk of defaults and financial losses.
